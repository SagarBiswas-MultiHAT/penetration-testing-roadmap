## 🎭 Introduction

**Feeling overwhelmed is normal!** Penetration testing is a vast field that combines networking, programming, system administration, and security expertise. This roadmap will help you build skills systematically rather than jumping around topics randomly.

### 🎯 Goals of This Roadmap
- **Structure**: Clear learning phases with defined objectives
- **Focus**: One skill at a time to avoid overwhelm
- **Practical**: Hands-on labs and real-world scenarios

## 🎯 Focus Strategy: Combat Overwhelm

### The "One Thing" Rule
**Each week, focus on mastering ONE primary skill.** Don't try to learn everything at once.

### Daily Structure (Recommended)
- **1 hour**: Reading/theory (books, articles, documentation)
- **2-3 hours**: Hands-on practice (labs, CTFs, tool practice)
- **30 minutes**: Note-taking and documentation

### Weekly Review Questions
1. What specific skill did I master this week?
2. What practical lab/exercise did I complete?
3. What would I do differently next week?
4. Am I ready to move to the next topic?
